{"name":"Jessewmc.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"#Hello Icom Productions!\r\n\r\nI put together this quick demo page of two of my recent projects. Again the code is unfortunately private since these are under contract, but I would be happy to give you a live demo in person and discuss more!\r\n\r\nAs an aside, my GitHub does have a few public repositories. [rubylife](https://github.com/jessewmc/rubylife), though fairly old now, is the best documented. This was my first Ruby project--a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life.\r\n\r\n##Box-All Storage Management\r\n\r\nBox-All Storage in Edmonton is a portable storage bin company. They needed a new system to manage their box inventory, customers, deliveries and invoicing. It had to work in the office (and be print-friendly) as well as on mobile for deliveries. I had some prior exposure to Ruby, and decided to use Rails for this project. Initially I hosted on Heroku for ease of use, but cost and flexibility led me to use Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk for production in the end. Amazon RDS gave me relatively robust Postgres hosting with backups (I also pull separate backups for Box-All regularly) as well.\r\n\r\nI went back and forth regularly with the Box-All manager to get his feedback on the software until we arrived at something that we were both happy with. I enjoy working directly with someone who uses my work to make life easier, it's very satisfying.\r\n\r\nSo, here we go. This is the login screen (complete with password reset emails and remembered sessions):\r\n\r\n![boxall login](/boxall/login.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see I am using Bootstrap for layout. A simple, clean interface was the main requirement here.\r\n\r\nAfter logging in:\r\n\r\n![boxall home](/boxall/home.png)\r\n\r\nOn this page we can see how many boxes are in use at a glance, todays deliveries which can be printed for the driver (or any other date by clicking the date), and currently active contracts. These screenshots are all local with fake customer data of course.\r\n\r\nHere is a customer view page, where we can see their info a glance, as well as create new contracts or edit customer data:\r\n\r\n![boxall customer](/boxall/customer.png)\r\n\r\nClicking new contract:\r\n\r\n![boxall new contract](/boxall/newcontract.png)\r\n\r\nWe can select the start date with jQuery Datepicker, and other options.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the page we can select from any containers not currently in use:\r\n\r\n![boxall contract boxes](/boxall/contractboxes.png)\r\n\r\nHere is a newly created contract overview:\r\n\r\n![boxall contract](/boxall/contract.png)\r\n\r\nDeliveries are scheduled on contracts. They show up on the home page as above, and also on the deliveries screen:\r\n\r\n![boxall deliveries](/boxall/deliveries.png)\r\n\r\nEach delivery shows the customer last name and number of boxes being delivered. Zero boxes on a delivery is allowed because Box-All often schedules deliveries before they know what boxes will be delivered. Deliveries can be clicked on for more details (such as destination and notes).\r\n\r\nHere we can see an overview of who has what. Box-All management specifically requested this feature.\r\n\r\n![boxall rationalization](/boxall/rationalization.png)\r\n\r\nInvoices are also generated on contracts:\r\n\r\n![boxall invoice](/boxall/invoice.png)\r\n\r\nThe Invoices index page:\r\n\r\n![boxall invoices](/boxall/invoices.png)\r\n\r\nKey features here include:\r\n* unpaid invoices are marked in red\r\n* search invoices by month (clicking on 'Search Invoice Month' drops down a jQuery month selector)\r\n* totals button shows monthly gross invoice totals\r\n\r\nSome other features not highlighted so far: Search for customers (name or phone), boxes, contracts. Print friendly views of contracts, invoices and daily deliveries where paper is still necessary. All views are mobile friendly.\r\n\r\nAll in all a fairly straightforward application, but I'm happy to say that I built it entirely myself and it is currently used in production at Box-All.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##LuaCAM CNC macros and program database\r\n\r\n![luacam search](/luacam/searchscreen.png)\r\n![luacam search progress](/luacam/searchprogress.png)\r\n![luacam program display](/luacam/progdisplay.png)\r\n![luacamcycle](/luacam/luacamcycle.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
