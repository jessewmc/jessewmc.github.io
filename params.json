Again the code is unfortunately private since these are under contract, but I would be happy to give you a live demo in person and discuss more!\r\n\r\n##Box-All Storage Management\r\n\r\nBox-All Storage in Edmonton is a portable storage bin company. They needed a new system to manage their box inventory, customers, and invoicing, so I offered to do it. I had some prior exposure to Ruby, and decided to learn rails for this project.\r\n\r\nHere is the login screen (complete with password reset emails and remembered sessions):\r\n![boxall login](/boxall/login.png)\r\nAs you can see I am using Bootstrap for layout. A simple, clean interface was the main requirement here.\r\n\r\nAfter logging in:\r\n![boxall home](/boxall/home.png)\r\nOn this page we can see how many boxes are in use at a glance, todays deliveries which can be printed for the driver (or any other date by clicking the date), and currently active contracts. Of course all of these customers were generated with Faker.\r\n\r\n![boxall contract](/boxall/contract.png)\r\n![boxall box](/boxall/box.png)\r\n![boxall rationalization](/boxall/rationalization.png)\r\n![boxall contract boxes](/boxall/contractboxes.png)\r\n![boxall boxes before](/boxall/contractboxesbefore.png)\r\n![boxall new contract](/boxall/newcontract.png)\r\n![boxall customer](/boxall/customer.png)\r\n![boxall invoice](/boxall/invoice.png)\r\n![boxall invoices](/boxall/invoices.png)\r\n![boxall deliveries](/boxall/deliveries.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##LuaCAM CNC macros and program database\r\n\r\n![luacam search](/luacam/searchscreen.png)\r\n![luacam search progress](/luacam/searchprogress.png)\r\n![luacam program display](/luacam/progdisplay.png)\r\n![luacamcycle](/luacam/luacamcycle.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
